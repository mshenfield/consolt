__developer console chat room__

Modern browser console's are pretty amazing - you can do introspection, do performance analysis, drag and drop elements of the DOM, and [a whole lot more](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console). I thought it would be fun to make a little chat room whose client and view lived entirely inside the chrome console.

And so, without further ado, here it is!

## Usage
To run:

```
cd consolt
npm install
node lib/index.js
```

Open two tabs at http://localhost:3000 and pull up the developer console in each to see it in action.

### Inside The Console
#### `chat(text)` (alias `c`)
Post a message to the chat room hosted on the page. Set a name with `setName` first.

#### `setName(name)` (alias `s`)
Set your name in the chat room.
